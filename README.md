# ML & AI Explorations

This repository documents my learning journey through machine learning and artificial intelligence. It includes practical notebooks, model evaluations, and conceptual summaries designed to build strong foundations and apply ML effectively.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- 🔹 Linear Regression
- 🔹 Logistic Regression
- 🔹 Ridge & Lasso Regularization
- 🔹 Evaluation Metrics (RMSE, R², Confusion Matrix, etc.)
- 🔹 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- 🔹 Coming Soon: Tree-Based Models, XGBoost, Neural Networks

## 📁 Structure

- `notebooks/` – Jupyter/Colab notebooks for each concept
- `notes/` – Markdown summaries and interview prep notes
- `datasets/` – Sample data used for experiments

## 🚀 Goal

To strengthen my practical ML/AI knowledge
