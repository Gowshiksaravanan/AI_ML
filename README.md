# AI_ML
A curated collection of my hands-on explorations, notes, and project implementations while learning Machine Learning and AI. Covers foundational models like Linear &amp; Logistic Regression, regularization techniques (Ridge/Lasso), and will expand to advanced topics including tree-based models, ensemble methods, and neural networks.
